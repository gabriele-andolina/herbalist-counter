            <h3>
                <p>In 1988, two young people met on an alpine trail. <br>
                    Aisling had been distracted by an edelweiss and gone a few steps off the track. <br>
                    Paolo had been distracted by the beautiful lady going off track 
                    and had decided that off track was, after all, a very sensible idea. 
                </p><br>
                <p>Fast forward a couple of hours (plus a couple of glasses of génépy) and the two
                    found out they were both fond of nature, hiking and herbs (and of each other too).
                </p><br>
                <p>She went back to Ireland to pursue her studies in Botany. <br>
                    He went back to Turin, his hometown, to pursue a degree in Herbal Sciences. <br>
                    They both found a way to pursue each other around Europe.

                    outlet in The Herbalist’s Counter, their shop in Turin’s city centre, <br>
                    a stone’s throw away from the famous Mole Antonelliana.

                <p>The Counter’s offer has kept on expanding since, <br> 
                    slowly but consistently coming to include <br>
                    a great variety of herbs and teas from around the world.

                <p>Some things have remained the same, though: <br> 
                    the two herbalists’ dedication to their work (more of an art, actually) and their customers, <br>
                    the quality of their products and <br> 
                    the pleasant herbal scent that welcomes those who visit.
