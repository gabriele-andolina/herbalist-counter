            <p>Linden, elder, eucalyptus, star anise... you name it, we have it. <br>
               And if we don’t, we’ll make sure to get it. <br>
               We make use of over 100 officinal herbs in our daily practice,
               selecting and blending them according to each person’s need.
            </p> <br>
            <p> High cholesterol? <br>
                    A herbal tea of dandelion root, Marian thistle and artichoke’s leaves 
                    can help with that.
            </p>
            <p> Anxiety and depression? <br>
                    Lemon balm, linden, hawthorn, St. John’s wort, passion flower
                    and rhodiola root will grant you some respite.
            </p>
            <p> Aphonia or raucousness? <br>
                    Why not sipping a hot brew of mallow, eucalyptus, thyme, 
                    hedge mustard,
                    lichen and sage to get your voice back?

            <p>Did you know that tea is the world’s second most-consumed beverage?
               (You can’t really beat water, you know.)
            </p> <br>
            <p>Tea was discovered in China around the year 2700 B.C.
                The legend goes that Shennong
                - a mythical ruler still venerated for his contributions 
                to agriculture and herbal medicine - 
                was the first one to taste it. 
            </p><br>
            <p>We weren’t around at that time, otherwise we would have made sure to share 
                a cup with him. Tea, however, has been around our shop since its opening, 
                and today we sell over 30 types of tea. Our teas come mainly from China and India,
                two countries we visit regularly to provide you with the best leaves, 
                but we also have some varieties from Sri Lanka, Japan and Kenya.

            <p>The great thing about herbs is that there’s an abundance of ways to use them.
                Once, during our summer vacation in Malaysia, I (Paolo) got a sunburn and managed 
                not to ruin the rest of the week thanks to a herb mix.
                In fact, our host concocted a local mixture of leaves I could use as an after-sun lotion,
                and it worked! 
            </p><br>
            <p>Soaps and perfumes are among the other herbal products our customers can find in our shop. 
                Many have come to the Counter looking for alternatives to the commercial products 
                out there, which often leave the most delicate skins irritated and damaged.
                We personally produce a good part of the soap we sell but also offer renowned ethnic 
                products such as the Aleppo soap. 
                Our perfumes come from three selected producers 
                that share with us an equal love and respect for nature.
