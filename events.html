                <p>Did you know that tea is the world’s second most-consumed beverage? <br>
                   (You can’t really beat water, you know.)
                </p> <br>
                <p>Tea was discovered in China around the year 2700 B.C. <br>
                   The legend goes that Shennong - a mythical ruler still venerated for his contributions 
                   to agriculture and herbal medicine - was the first one to taste it. 
                </p><br>
                <p>We weren’t around at that time, otherwise we would have made sure to share 
                    a cup with him. Tea, however, has been around our shop since its opening, 
                    and today we sell over 30 types of tea. Our teas come mainly from China and India,
                    two countries we visit regularly to provide you with the best leaves, 
                    but we also have some varieties from Sri Lanka, Japan and Kenya.
