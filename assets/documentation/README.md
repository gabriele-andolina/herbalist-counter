# **The Herbalist's Counter**

The Herbalist's Counter is the website for a herbalist's shop located in Turin, Italy. It is aimed both at first-time customers who are looking for a herbalist in the area and at returning customers who know the shop.

The goal of the Counter and its website is not only to advertise its products for commercial purposes, but also to educate people about the properties of herbs and herbal medicine, thus promoting a healthier lifestyle for all.

## **Site Owners' Goals and User Types**
### Site Owners' Goals
The two herbalists who own the website have two objectives in mind: to make their shop and products known, as well as to educate people about herbs and, more generally, the abundance of natural remedies they have studied and benefited from for years. They have a commercial purpose in mind, in that they make a living out of their herbalist's shop, but they also want to improve their customers' health condition through herbal medicine. Their website is the way to do that: on the one hand, they clearly state what kind of products can be found and purchased in their shop; on the other hand, they tell users a story - their story, how they met, how their passion for and knowledge about herbs have come to be - and they promote two monthly events customers can attend to learn about herbs, try the shop's products and hopefully socialise in the process.
### User Types
* First-time user/visitor:
The first type of website users are the people in search of a herbalist in the city of Turin. They don't know the Counter yet, so they open their browser and search for such a shop in the city. Among the results, they find out about The Herbalist's Counter: who the owners are, what products are on offer, where the shop is located. These users are also intrigued by the fact that the shop organizes two monthly events and therefore decide to go see the place for themselves.
* Returning user/visitor:
The second type of users are already acquainted with the shop, having already been there in the past and enjoyed the experience. They have taken part in the Herbal Friday event once or twice, have had fun there and learnt something new about herbs. They are now in need of another visit to the shop, for instance to purchase a herbal tea for their cold, and they open the website to remind themselves of the opening hours. When they land on the Counter's website, they find out that a Tea Ceremony event will be hosted soon and take note to ask the two owners about it.
